# Exercise #1

Running `index.js` should output

```txt
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
```

But instead fails to import the file that contains the `show` function.

1. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.

1. Run `node index.js` and watch it fail to import the `show` function.

1. Fix it! Try to fix it without touching the source code!

1. Alternatively, change the specifier to make it work
